Instead, I\\'m going to take you home for a terrific dinner cooked by my wife.\"The homeless man was astounded. \"Won\\'t your wife be furious with you for doing that? I know I\\'m dirty, and I probably smell pretty disgusting.\"The man replied, \"That\\'s okay. It\\'s important for her to see what a man looks like after he has given up beer, fishing, golf, and sex.\" #joke #beer Read more on page http://www.jokesoftheday.net'"
